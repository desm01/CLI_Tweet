# CLI_Tweet

Tweet using the command line interface. (You'll need a Twitter Developer Account)

When prompoted enter your keys which you recieve at the Twitter Dev portal



To run the script as a command in a Unix terminal.

Step One: Add a shebang line to the top of the tweetPy.py file. For me it's:
#!/usr/bin/python3.8

Step Two: Make tweetPy.py executable:
chmod +x tweetPy.py

Step Three: Make a directory in your home folder called bin and copy / paste tweetPy.py there
cd $HOME
mkdir bin
(Copy / Paste tweetPy.py here)

Step Four: Add HOME/bin to your $PATH directory
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

Step Five: Reboot PC

Step Six: Type tweetPy.py to execute the program from the terminal

Enjoy :)
